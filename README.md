# Housing Price Analysis

**Author**: Brian Lee

## Overview

For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county. The descriptive analysis of the King County Housing dataset show that specific factors have a larger influence on the price at which a home is sold. The real estate agency can use this information to have a greater profit in selling homes to their customers, using their greater understanding in general customer preference.

## Business Problem

A King County real estate agency has requested us for help in predicting housing prices. They would like to figure out which factors have the greatest effect on the price of the home. They want to cater to average home buyers. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the real estate agency can use to better sell the homes in the market.

## The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder.
